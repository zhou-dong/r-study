### Baisc

---

#### R has five basic or "atomic" classes of objects

- character
- numeric (real numbers)
- integer
- complex
- logic (True/False)

#### The most baisc object is vector

- A vector and only contain objects of the same class.
- BUT: The one exception is list, which represent a vector but can contain objects of different classes(indeed, that's usually why we use them)

#### Numbers in R a generally treated as numeric objects

- typeof(1): [1] "double"
- typeof(1L): [1] "integer"

#### Attributes

- names, dimnames
- dimensions
- class
- length
- other user-defined attributes/metadata 

Attributes of object can be accessed using the attributes() function.

### Creating vectors

#### the c() function:

- x <- c(0.5, 0.6)
- y <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
- z <- c(T, F)
- a <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
- b <- 9:20
- c <- c(1+0i, 2+4i)

#### using the vector() function

- x <- vector("numeric", length=10)

#### Mixing Object

- x <- c(1.7 'a') ##character
- y <- c(TRUE, 2) ##numeric
- z <- c('a', TRUE) ##character
