## R has five basic or "atomic" classes of objects

- character
- numeric (real numbers)
- integer
- complex
- logic (True/False)

## The most baisc object is vector

- A vector and only contain objects of the same class.
- BUT: The one exception is list, which represent a vector but can contain objects of different classes(indeed, that's usually why we use them)

## Numbers in R a generally treated as numeric objects

- typeof(1): [1] "double"
- typeof(1L): [1] "integer"
