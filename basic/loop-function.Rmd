lapply

- The lapply() function takes a list as input, applies a function to each element of the list, then returns a list of the same length as the original one.
- The 'l' in 'lapply' stands for 'list'.

```R
cls_list <- lapply(flags, class)
```

```R
x <- list(a=1:5, b=rnorm(10), c=rnorm(20,1), c=rnorm(100,5))
lapply(x, mean)
```

```R
$a
[1] 3
$b
[1] 0.3057864
$c
[1] 0.6914496
$c
[1] 5.133292
```
sapply

1. result <- lapply()
2. as.character(result)

In general, if the result is a list where every element is of length one, then sapply() returns a vector. If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (> 1), sapply() returns a matrix. If sapply() can't figure things out, then it just returns a list, no different from what lapply() would give you.

```R

```

apply

```R
> x <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)
> x
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    5    9   13
[2,]    2    6   10   14
[3,]    3    7   11   15
[4,]    4    8   12   16
```

```R
> apply(x, 1, mean)
[1]  7  8  9 10
```

```R
> mean(x[1,])
[1] 7
> mean(x[2,])
[1] 8
> mean(x[3,])
[1] 9
> mean(x[4,])
[1] 10
```
mapply

```R
 mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)
[[1]]
[1] 1 1 1 1

[[2]]
[1] 2 2 2

[[3]]
[1] 3 3

[[4]]
[1] 4
```
tapply

split

- Take a vector or other objects and split into groups determined by a factor or list of factors.
