lapply

always return list

```R
x <- list(a=1:5, b=rnorm(10), c=rnorm(20,1), c=rnorm(100,5))
lapply(x, mean)
```

```R
$a
[1] 3
$b
[1] 0.3057864
$c
[1] 0.6914496
$c
[1] 5.133292
```

apply

```R
> x <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)
> x
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    5    9   13
[2,]    2    6   10   14
[3,]    3    7   11   15
[4,]    4    8   12   16
```

```R
> apply(x, 1, mean)
[1]  7  8  9 10
```

```R
> mean(x[1,])
[1] 7
> mean(x[2,])
[1] 8
> mean(x[3,])
[1] 9
> mean(x[4,])
[1] 10
```
mapply

```R
