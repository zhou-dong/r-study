Function is also an object, like in JavaScript

- Function is an object
- Function can be pass to another object
- No return keyword in function
- Function argument can be matched by name

Example:

```R
add2 <- function(x, y){
    x + y
}
```

steps of improve function

```R
x <- 1:20
above10 <- function(x){
    use <- x > 10
    x[use]
}
r <- above10(x)
print(r)
```

```R
aboveN <- function(x, n){
    use <- x > n
    x[use]
}
r <- aboveN(x, 10)
print(r)
```

```R
aboveN <- function(x, n=10){
    use <- x > n
    x[use]
}
r <- aboveN(x)
print(r)
```

Environment

- An environment is a collection of (symble, value) pairs.
- Every environment has a parent environment; it is possible an environment has muliply children.
- the only environment without parent is empty environment.
- A function + an environment = a closure or function closure.
