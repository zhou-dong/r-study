### Subsetting 

---

1. [] :
    - always return an object of the same class as the original; 
    - can be used to selected more than one element.
2. [[]] : 
    - is used to extract element of a list or data frames; 
    - it can be only be used to extract a single element 
    - and the class of return object will not necessary to be list or data frame.
3. $
    - is used to extract element of a list or data frames by name
    - semantics are similar to hat of [[]]
    
#### Baisc 

##### numeric index

```R
> x <- c('a','b','c','c','d','a')
> x
[1] "a" "b" "c" "c" "d" "a"
> x[1]
[1] "a"
> x[2]
[1] "b"
> x[1:4]
[1] "a" "b" "c" "c"
> x[4:1]
[1] "c" "c" "b" "a"
```

##### logical index

```R
> x [x>'a']
[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
> u <- x>'a'
> u
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
> x[u]
[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"
```
